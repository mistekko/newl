newl is a Pywal theme manager which encourages the user to store and manually tweak their themes rather than simply passing an argument to the =-i= flag and calling it a day.

** Features

- pick your theme from the command line, via dmenu, or graphically via =[n]sxiv=
- edit, update, or delete active theme with a single command
- set a random theme

** Installation

Installation of shell scripts is trivial: simply place it in a directory in your =$PATH=. 

*** Required dependencies
- dmenu
- Pywal16
- ImageMagick (for icon creation; newl'll run without, but it'll print a few errors)

*** Optional dependencies
Use of these programs is hardcoded into the source, but it's trivial to remove them and replace them with whatever you find more suitable.
- emacs
- pywalfox
- dwm with the dwmc and xrdb patches

** Usage

First, you'll need a theme. Make one the normal way (=wal -i <image>=).
Then, come up with a name for the theme, say, =<theme>=, and run =newl n <theme>=.
Your theme should be created. Run =newl l= to verify.
You can apply this theme at any time with =newl a <theme>=.
For more information, try =newl -h=... or just read the source code.
